// Package reliable is OpenVPN's control-channel reliability algorithm: the
// sliding-window retransmitting sender and the reordering, acknowledging
// receiver that together turn UDP into the ordered, lossless byte stream the TLS
// handshake needs.
//
// It is deliberately decoupled from the wire format and from session IDs: it
// works in terms of message payloads and 32-bit packet IDs, so the retransmit,
// reorder, dedup and ACK logic can be tested without sockets or crypto. The
// control channel (which owns session IDs, wire encoding, and the net.Conn the
// TLS layer runs over) drives a Sender and a Receiver.
//
// OpenVPN numbers each side's control messages from 0, delivers them to TLS in
// strict ascending order, and acknowledges every one it receives — re-acking
// duplicates, since a lost ACK is why a peer retransmits (reliable.c, ssl_pkt.c).
