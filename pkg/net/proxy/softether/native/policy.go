// The session policy the server states in its welcome PACK.
//
// SoftEther's POLICY (Cedar/Account.h) is the server's declaration of what a
// session may do: whether it has access at all, which packet classes are
// filtered, how many MAC and IP addresses it may claim, what bandwidth it gets.
// It crosses the wire not as a structure but as three dozen flat elements in
// the welcome PACK, each named "policy:" + the field name -- PackAddPolicy in
// Cedar/Protocol.c, and PackGetPolicy reading them back.
//
// **Sending it is not what made a real client connect, and this comment exists
// so nobody re-derives that the hard way.** internal/softether/README.md used
// to name the missing policy as one of two things blocking SoftEther's own
// client against veepin's server. It was not: PackGetPolicy allocates a
// zeroed POLICY and fills it from whatever elements are present, so a welcome
// with none of them parses -- and the client enforces only two of the fields
// locally (AutoDisconnect and NoSavePassword), for which zero is the
// permissive value. The actual blocker was in the HTTP layer; see
// readSignature.
//
// It is sent anyway, for a reason that is not compatibility: an omitted
// element gives the client the value we wanted *by accident*. "Do not
// auto-disconnect this session" and "we did not mention auto-disconnect" arrive
// identically, and the first is a statement while the second is a coincidence
// that holds only as long as PackGetPolicy keeps zero-filling. Every flag below
// is false because this server enforces no such restriction, which is a fact
// about veepin worth putting on the wire rather than leaving to a default.

// Policy is the subset of SoftEther's POLICY this server has anything to say
// about. The restriction flags are all absent rather than listed: veepin's
// switch enforces none of them, so every one is false, and a struct field per
// unenforced restriction would be three dozen fields that can only hold one
// value.

	// MaxConnection is how many TCP connections the session may hold. It is
	// the policy's copy of the welcome's own max_connection, and the reference

	// either sees the same number.

	// which is what the welcome's own "timeout" element carries. The two units
	// sit three lines apart in PackWelcome and are easy to conflate.
