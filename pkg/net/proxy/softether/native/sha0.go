// SHA-0 (FIPS 180, 1993), the withdrawn predecessor of SHA-1.
//
// SoftEther hashes every password with it, so a peer that wants to log in has
// to reproduce it. Go ships SHA-1 and not SHA-0, and the difference between
// them is one instruction: SHA-1 rotates the expanded message word left by one
// bit, SHA-0 does not.
//
//	SHA-1:  W[t] = ROTL1(W[t-3] ^ W[t-8] ^ W[t-14] ^ W[t-16])
//	SHA-0:  W[t] =       W[t-3] ^ W[t-8] ^ W[t-14] ^ W[t-16]
//
// That omission is why SHA-0 was withdrawn: it is the reason collisions were
// found against it years before SHA-1 fell. Nothing here depends on it being
// collision resistant — see the caveats in README.md — but it is the wire
// format, and the wire format is not ours to choose.
//
// It is deliberately unexported and package-local, the same treatment
// internal/ikev2/eap/md4.go gives MD4 for MSCHAPv2's NT hash: a legacy digest
// a protocol mandates, confined to the one corner that mandates it, rather
// than offered from internal/cryptoutil as though it were a choice a caller
// should be able to make.
//
// # Where this came from
//
// SoftEtherVPN/src/Mayaqua/Encrypt.c, MY_SHA0_Transform. The rotate is absent
// there in a way worth recording, because it reads as a bug and is not one:
//
//	//W[t] = rol(1,W[t-3] ^ W[t-8] ^ W[t-14] ^ W[t-16]);
//	W[t] = (1,W[t-3] ^ W[t-8] ^ W[t-14] ^ W[t-16]);
//
// The live line is a C comma expression. It evaluates 1, discards it, and
// yields the xor — so the rotate the commented-out line above it would have
// applied never happens, and the result is exactly SHA-0. Whether that was
// intended or was a rename that went one step too far, it is what every
// SoftEther server on the wire computes, so it is what this computes.

// sha0Size is the digest length in octets, the same 20 as SHA-1.
const sha0Size = 20

// sha0 returns the SHA-0 digest of data.
//
// The structure is SHA-1's, because SHA-0 *is* SHA-1 but for the message
// schedule: same initial state, same round constants, same four round
// functions at the same boundaries, same big-endian length padding.
