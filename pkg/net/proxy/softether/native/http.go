// The HTTP layer SE-VPN puts in front of its control PACKs.
//
// A SoftEther connection does not begin with a PACK. It begins with an HTTP
// exchange that looks like a browser fetching a JPEG, and only then are PACKs
// carried as HTTP bodies, one PACK per message, until the connection is
// switched to the raw data path:
//
//	client                                                     server
//	  |-- POST /vpnsvc/connect.cgi  Content-Type: image/jpeg ---->|  the signature
//	  |    body: "VPNCONNECT" (or the watermark blob)             |
//	  |<-- 200 OK  application/octet-stream: PACK{hello,random} --|  ServerUploadHello
//	  |-- POST /vpnsvc/vpn.cgi      application/octet-stream ---->|  PACK{method=login}
//	  |    body: PACK{method,hubname,username,authtype,...}       |
//	  |<-- 200 OK  application/octet-stream: PACK{welcome,...} ---|
//	  |=================== raw blocks, see frame.go ==============|
//
// Two details decide whether a real server answers at all.
//
// **The POST target is not the same for both stages.** The signature goes to
// /vpnsvc/connect.cgi (HTTP_VPN_TARGET2) and every PACK after it to
// /vpnsvc/vpn.cgi (HTTP_VPN_TARGET). ServerDownloadSignature compares the
// target against connect.cgi and answers 404 for anything else, so a client
// that uses one path throughout gets a 404 it will read as a network fault.
//
// **The server accepts a ten-octet string in place of the watermark.**
// ServerDownloadSignature admits a body that is either the WaterMark blob (a
// ~1 KB image, present in the source as a byte array) or exactly the string
// "VPNCONNECT" (HTTP_VPN_TARGET_POSTDATA). The short form is what this sends:
// it is a documented branch of the peer's own acceptance test rather than a
// shortcut around it, and it keeps a kilobyte of somebody else's image data
// out of the tree.
//
// **The signature is not necessarily the first request on the connection.**
// The diagram above is what veepin's own client sends, and it is not what
// SoftEther's client sends: `vpnclient` opens with `GET /` before it posts the
// signature. ServerDownloadSignature is a *loop* -- up to nineteen requests,
// the same count its own Keep-Alive header advertises -- answering anything
// that is not the signature the way a web server would and reading the next
// request. A server that treats the first request as the signature refuses
// every real client on its opening move, which is exactly what this one did
// until a cell was pointed at `vpnclient`.

// The HTTP constants, from SoftEtherVPN/src/Mayaqua/HTTP.h. Named exactly as
// the reference names them so the two can be diffed.
