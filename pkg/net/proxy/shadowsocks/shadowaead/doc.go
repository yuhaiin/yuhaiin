// Package shadowaead implements a simple AEAD-protected secure protocol.
//
// In general, there are two types of connections: stream-oriented and packet-oriented.
// Stream-oriented connections (e.g. TCP) assume reliable and orderly delivery of bytes.
// Packet-oriented connections (e.g. UDP) assume unreliable and out-of-order delivery of packets,
// where each packet is either delivered intact or lost.
//
// An encrypted stream starts with a random salt to derive a session key, followed by any number of
// encrypted records. Each encrypted record has the following structure:
//
//	[encrypted payload length]
//	[payload length tag]
//	[encrypted payload]
//	[payload tag]
//
// Payload length is 2-byte unsigned big-endian integer capped at 0x3FFF (16383).
// The higher 2 bits are reserved and must be set to zero. The first AEAD encrypt/decrypt
// operation uses a counting nonce starting from 0. After each encrypt/decrypt operation,
// the nonce is incremented by one as if it were an unsigned little-endian integer.
//
// Each encrypted packet transmitted on a packet-oriented connection has the following structure:
//
//	[random salt]
//	[encrypted payload]
//	[payload tag]
//
// The salt is used to derive a subkey to initiate an AEAD. Packets are encrypted/decrypted independently
// using zero nonce.
//
// In both stream-oriented and packet-oriented connections, length of nonce and tag varies
// depending on which AEAD is used. Salt should be at least 16-byte long.
